//! Entry point for the Rusty CHIP-8 emulator binary.
//!
//! Responsibilities handled here:
//! - Instantiate the `Chip8` VM.
//! - Load a ROM file (currently hard-coded as `rom.ch8`).
//! - Reset / initialise memory state.
//! - Run the main emulation loop: CPU step, timers, drawing, sound.
//! - Pace execution to (approximately) 60 Hz for timers / display.
//!
//! Future improvements that could live here:
//! - Command-line argument parsing for ROM path.
//! - Configurable clock speeds (CPU vs timer frequency).
//! - Proper sound generation instead of `println!("beep!")`.
//! - Graceful exit on key press / window close.

/// Main entry point.
///
/// Flow:
/// 1. Create a new `Chip8` instance.
/// 2. Load the ROM bytes from `rom.ch8` into memory starting at the conventional 0x200 address.
/// 3. Optionally reset memory (currently clears it after loading; you likely want to remove `reset_memory()` if it wipes the ROM region).
/// 4. Enter an infinite loop performing one CPU step per iteration.
/// 5. If the draw flag is set, invoke display rendering.
/// 6. Decrement delay and sound timers at ~60 Hz. When the sound timer hits zero after being positive, print a placeholder beep.
/// 7. Sleep the remainder of the 60 Hz frame period so timers approximate real time.
///
/// Timing:
/// - `interval` is ~16.666 ms (1/60 s) expressed in microseconds.
/// - We measure elapsed time for each loop; if shorter than the desired interval we sleep the difference.
/// - If longer, we skip sleeping (frame is late) and continue immediately.
///
/// NOTE: `reset_memory()` after loading a ROM may erase the just loaded program depending on its implementation. If it clears the entire memory array you should move the call before `load_rom()` or remove it.
